#Programming Assignment 3
#Writeup


 This programming assignment is really based on how to use loops.
 I've decided to use the oranges I've created from the previous assignment to
 show my loops. I've also use the interpolation command in this assignment.
 I made my oranges change sizes as they went along also.
